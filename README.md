# jsext
Commonly-useful extensions for Scala.js

In the course of developing Querki, including quite a lot of complex facades, I've found some common problems. This is a tiny library to help make it easier to deal with those.

## Installation

To use jsext, add this line to your Scala.js project's libraryDependencies:
```
"org.querki" %%% "querki-jsext" % "0.5"
```

## RichFuture

jsext takes advantage of things you can do in Scala.js that aren't as easy in the JVM, to enhance Future with a few nice features.

### withTimeout

If you build a complex application in Scala.js, you will find that asynchronous programming winds up front-and-center. There are basically two ways to deal with this: either you make things deeply reactive (usually using the Facebook React library), or you do a lot of Future composition.

Future composition is actually quite easy in Scala.js, and works well, but there is one key weakness: Scala's standard Future implementation has no concept of timeout. This is mildly inconvenient if you want your UI to be able to do things like time out requests, and it's a big problem if you are trying to test this Futures-based code using a package like utest.

So RichFuture (which is available implicitly if you import org.querki.jsext._) adds several methods to address this. `failAfter()` is the general case, and allows you to specify the timeout duration and the message to give in case of failure; the two overloads of `withTimeout` are simpler variations of that. All of them have the same general purpose: they take a Future, and return a version of that Future that will fail (with a TimeoutException) after the specified amount of time.

If you are using utest, and your tests end with Futures, I strongly recommend injecting one of these timeouts into the test. It essentially allows you to assert that the Future completes, and avoids inconvenient hangs when it doesn't.

### notYet

This is sort of the inverse of `withTimeout`, and is also motivated largely by testing. It is best explained with an example.

Say that you have some code along roughly these lines:
```
def setup(watcher:Watcher):PreppedStuff = {
  val readyFuture:Future[ReadyInfo] = remoteConnection.doSomeRemoteStuff()
  readyFuture.foreach { readyInfo =>
    finalSetup(readyInfo)
    watcher.fullyReady(this)
  }
  val prepped = doSomeLocalPrep()
  prepped
}
```
That looks a bit specific, but the broad strokes are pretty common in Web clients: you have some code that needs to go do some slow remote work before signaling readiness.

That all works great, until you go to do unit tests. Say that you have a stub implementation of RemoteConnection, which returns ReadyInfo synchronously -- often the easiest way to do things. But that means that watcher.fullyReady() is going to get called *before* setup() returns, often causing strange errors.

You can fix this by restructuring your code, but that's often a pain, and can cause contortions that make your code messier just for testing. What you *really* want is to simply ensure that readyFuture doesn't fire synchronously, because your code is structured that way. That's where `notYet` comes in. You simply change your foreach like this:
```
  readyFuture.notYet.foreach { readyInfo =>
    finalSetup(readyInfo)
    watcher.fullyReady(this)
  }
```
`notYet` is a method on RichFuture that simply guarantees that the Future it returns will not be complete right now. If the real Future is still pending, it returns that. If the real Future is complete, it injects a minimal 1-ms delay, and returns a Future that will be complete after that time.

Alternatively, if you want to put the not-synchronous guarantee into the test code and not touch the real code, you can use notYet there:
```
class RemoteConnectionStub {
  def doSomeRemoteStuff() = {
    Future.successful(new ReadyInfo()).notYet
  }
}
```

Note that this pattern would be trickier in the JVM, where there is no native scheduler and there are dangerous potential race conditions. But in the single-threaded JS environment, it works nicely, and allows you to guarantee that a code path will be asynchronous, so you don't have to worry about it getting screwed up by a synchronous return.

(Note that this depends on `setTimeout()`, which AFAIK is non-standard but more or less universally implemented.)

## JSOptionBuilder

JSOptionBuilder is designed to deal with a common problem in building facades, especially facades of JQuery widgets.

A typical such facade is usually initialized with an "options" object that defines its exact behavior. The problem is
that these options objects often contain many fields -- 20-40 fields are not unusual -- some of which are polymorphic in a way that is hard to
represent in Scala. (Since JavaScript is loosely typed, you can have polymorphic unions simply by accepting several different types for a parameter, and
testing what actually got passed in to figure out the type.) The result is a combinatoric explosion, where a single options object could potentially
require hundreds, even thousands of strongly-typed constructors in order to properly represent it.

There are several potential ways to deal with this problem. In JSOptionBuilder, we choose not to even try to define a Scala constructor for the options
object. Instead, we build the options object up through a series of chained function calls. That tames the polymorphism, since each field can be a
separate overloaded function.

### Defining a JSOptionBuilder

JSOptionBuilder is easiest to understand with a worked-out example. In this case, we are going to use jQuery UI's Dialog widget, which has about 30
fields. (You can find the full definition of this Widget [in the jQuery UI API documentation](http://api.jqueryui.com/dialog/). The facade of the widget
itself is quite simple:
```
trait JQueryUIDialogFacade extends js.Object {
  def dialog(options:DialogOptions):JQuery = js.native
}
```
That is, this says that the referenced jQuery object should be considered a Dialog, using the specified DialogOptions. All the work comes in defining
DialogOptions.

To begin with, we provide three related definitions:
```
trait DialogOptions extends js.Object 
object DialogOptions extends DialogOptionBuilder(noOpts)
class DialogOptionBuilder(val dict:OptMap) extends JSOptionBuilder[DialogOptions, DialogOptionBuilder](new DialogOptionBuilder(_)) {
}
```
The `DialogOptions` trait is what we're trying to produce: a facade for the options object that we'll pass into the `dialog()` function above.

The `DialogOptions` *companion object* is an empty DialogOptions. It is legal to pass into `dialog()` (after the implicit conversions we will talk
about later), but is nothing but defaults.

All the interesting stuff goes into the `DialogOptionBuilder` class. Into this, we put a bunch of declarations, one for each overload of each
field, like these:
```
  def appendTo(v:String) = jsOpt("appendTo", v)
  
  def autoOpen(v:Boolean) = jsOpt("autoOpen", v)
  
  def buttons(v:js.Dictionary[js.Function0[Any]]) = jsOpt("buttons", v)
  def buttons(v:js.Array[js.Object]) = jsOpt("buttons", v)
```
That is, for each field, we define a method that takes the type that is legal to pass into that field. We pass that value into jsOpt(),
which returns a new DialogOptionBuilder with that value added -- everything is immutable, and you chain these calls together to get the
fully-constructed options object. If a field accepts multiple types, then you define one overload of the function for each type.

Note that the JSOptionBuilder companion object includes an implicit def, which converts from the Builder to the target trait.

### Using the JSOptionBuilder

Using the resulting class is done with chained function calls instead of a constructor, but the number of characters you actually type
is roughly the same. A typical call looks like this:
```
val asDialog = $(elem).dialog(DialogOptions.
  title(dialogTitle).
  height(height).width(width).
  buttons(buttonMap)
)
```
That is, we start with the `DialogOptions` object defined above (which, remember, is the completely empty default options). We
call the functions for the fields we want to set, chaining them together. The implicit def detects that we are passing this into
`dialog()`, so it converts it from DialogOptionBuilder into DialogOptions.

The resulting code is reasonably concise, and strongly-typed: in good Scala fashion, type errors will be usually be caught in the IDE.

### Summary

If you are building a facade called Foo that takes an options object, you would usually define the following code:
```
trait FooFacade extends js.Object {
  def foo(options:FooOptions):JQuery = js.native
}
trait FooOptions extends js.Object 
object FooOptions extends FooOptionBuilder(noOpts)
class FooOptionBuilder(val dict:OptMap) extends JSOptionBuilder[FooOptions, FooOptionBuilder](new FooOptionBuilder(_)) {
  def field1(v:someType) = jsOpt("field1", v)
  
  def field2(v:someType) = jsOpt("field2", v)
  def field2(v:someOtherType) = jsOpt("field2", v)
  
  // ... one jsOpt for each overload of each field
}
```
That's pretty much it. There's a little boilerplate, but not too much, and the resulting facade works well.

Obviously, the details may vary -- use common sense when applying this pattern. But it works as described for a large
number of jQuery widgets.

### TO DO

Some of the boilerplate involved in using JSOptionBuilder could probably be tamed with a few macros.
